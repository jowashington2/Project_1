# Project_1
Programming language Project 1


This project is a Python-based Roman numeral calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on Roman numerals. It handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while following Roman numeral rules. It supports expressions using parentheses and brackets, and respects the order of operations (PEMDAS).

Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Order of Operations: Handles expressions with parentheses () and brackets [], following proper precedence.
Roman Numeral Constraints: Outputs valid Roman numerals for integers from 1 to 3,999.
Error Handling: Provides meaningful error messages for unsupported inputs (fractions, zero, negative numbers, or numbers above 3,999).

Error Handling
The calculator will display error messages for unsupported operations:

Zero: Outputs 0 does not exist in Roman numerals.
Negative Numbers: Outputs Negative numbers can't be represented in Roman numerals.
Fractions: Outputs There is no concept of a fractional number in Roman numerals.
Numbers Above 3,999: Outputs You're going to need a bigger calculator.
Invalid Input: Outputs I don't know how to read this.
